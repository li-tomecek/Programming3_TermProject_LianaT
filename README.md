#  ~ Spell Masters ~

Developed with Unity (6000.1.9).<br>
This project was a solo term project intended to practice programming patterns with Unity scripting, as well as UI/UX design and practice. I chose to make a simple single-player game of rock-paper-scissors.

## Description

The player and opponent both wield two sigils, each containing spell orbs of different types: **Holy, Dark,** and **Arcane.** <br>
These follow a **Spell Triangle** to determine the outcome of each duel:<br>

</p>


Each turn the player must secretly choose which new spells to cast on the opponent in the hopes that they will win their duels and deal damage to the opponent. The left and right duels occur independently of one another.

The player may also use **skill cards** (drawn from a deck each turn) to trigger additional effects such as recoil damage, healing, or forcing the opponent to choose specific spells.

Be careful, the opponent will not always choose their spells randomly! It will start by attempting to win as many duels as possible and become less agressive and more convervative with their health as it goes below certain thresholds.

## Windows Build
A zipped folder containing a windows build can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxTzi54Nz3-vsiCQQcLtacK76BMyszWM/view?usp=drive_link).<br>
Unzip the folder and launch Programming3_TermProject.exe to try out the game.
